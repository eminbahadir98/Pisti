A card game known as Bastra.

I used Visual Basic 2008 Express Edition for this game.

I wrote this card game with lack of experience and knowledge in Visual Basic and general algorithms. So it contains some useless operations and ram storage.

I don't recommend you to use this program's code as an example card game. Because; I figured out most of the mechanics with "Trial and error" method and the variable names are in Turkish.
